## Common Interview Questions🔥(HR)

### ✅ **HR / Behavioral Questions**


#### **1. Tell me about yourself.**

> I’m a Full Stack Web Developer with experience in the MERN stack—MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js. I started my journey by building personal projects and freelancing, which helped me develop real-world problem-solving skills. I’ve worked on e-commerce platforms, collaborative tools, and RESTful APIs. I’m also familiar with tools like Git, Postman, Tailwind CSS, and Redux Toolkit. I enjoy working in fast-paced environments, and I’m always looking to learn new technologies and improve my craft.



#### **2. What are your strengths and weaknesses?**

**Strengths:**

> * Strong problem-solving skills
> * Quick learner and self-motivated
> * Good team player with excellent communication skills
> * Detail-oriented and able to write clean, maintainable code

**Weaknesses:**

> * I used to spend too much time trying to perfect every detail, which sometimes slowed me down. But now, I balance quality with deadlines by focusing on the bigger picture and prioritizing tasks effectively.



#### **3. Why do you want to work here?**

> I’ve researched your company and found that your work in \[mention domain—e.g., ed-tech, fintech, AI, etc.] aligns with my passion for building scalable and impactful applications. I’m particularly impressed by your commitment to innovation and the collaborative culture mentioned on Glassdoor and LinkedIn. I believe working here will provide the challenges and learning environment I’m looking for.



#### **4. Why should we hire you?**

> I bring a combination of technical skills, a learning mindset, and a strong work ethic. I’ve built multiple real-world projects that required frontend and backend integration, and I’ve collaborated with designers and other developers. I also understand the importance of writing secure, efficient code and am confident that I can contribute value from day one.



#### **5. Where do you see yourself in 5 years?**

> In 5 years, I aim to be a senior developer or technical lead, guiding teams and helping design system architectures. I also hope to mentor junior developers, contribute to open-source, and play a role in decision-making processes that drive innovation.


#### **6. Why did you leave your last job (or want to leave your current one)?**

> I’m looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow. While I’m grateful for the experience I gained, I felt that I had outgrown the learning curve there. I want to join a company where I can work on more complex problems, learn from experienced peers, and contribute to impactful projects.



#### **7. Tell me about a time you faced a challenge at work and how you handled it.**

> In one of my freelance projects, I faced a situation where a third-party API changed its response structure overnight. It broke the entire data fetching logic. I immediately communicated the issue to the client, updated the response handling logic, and added error boundaries to prevent similar issues. The fix was delivered in under 4 hours, minimizing downtime.



#### **8. Describe a situation where you worked in a team.**

> While building a collaborative drawing app using React and WebSockets, I worked with a designer, another developer, and a QA tester. We used Git for version control and Trello for task management. We held daily standups and ensured clear communication, which led to smooth project execution and timely delivery.



#### **9. What motivates you?**

> Solving real-world problems through code and seeing users benefit from the products I build is highly motivating. I also enjoy continuous learning and the satisfaction that comes with overcoming technical challenges.



#### **10. How do you handle criticism or failure?**

> I see criticism as a growth opportunity. I make sure to listen without becoming defensive, reflect on the feedback, and apply it to improve. For example, I once got feedback that my code lacked comments. I’ve since made it a habit to write clear, self-explanatory code with meaningful documentation.



#### **11. How do you manage stress or pressure?**

> I break down tasks into smaller chunks and prioritize them. I also take short breaks to stay fresh and often use the Pomodoro technique to stay productive. I find that having a clear plan and communicating proactively reduces stress significantly.


#### **12. Describe a time you disagreed with your manager or team member. How did you handle it?**

> During a project, I disagreed with a teammate over using a specific third-party library. Instead of arguing, I created a simple prototype using both approaches and presented the pros and cons. The team agreed on the better option based on performance and future scalability.


#### **13. What are your salary expectations?**

> I’m open to negotiation and more focused on the role, responsibilities, and the opportunity to grow. That said, based on industry standards and my skills, I would expect a fair and competitive salary in the range of ₹X – ₹Y LPA (you can adjust based on your experience and location).



#### **14. Are you willing to relocate or travel?**

> Yes, I am open to relocation and occasional travel if the opportunity is rewarding and aligns with my career goals.



#### **15. What do you know about our company?**

> I know that your company is a leader in \[industry/domain], has a strong reputation for innovation, and is known for a collaborative and inclusive work culture. I saw your recent product launch on \[LinkedIn/website], which showed your commitment to solving real user problems and staying ahead of trends.


### 🧩 **Situational / Decision-Making Questions**



#### **16. Tell me about a time you made a mistake. What did you learn from it?**

> I once pushed code directly to the main branch without reviewing it properly, which caused a minor bug in production. I took responsibility, fixed the bug quickly, and since then, I always follow proper Git workflows with code reviews and testing before merging.



#### **17. How do you prioritize tasks when you have multiple deadlines?**

> I list down all the tasks, estimate the time for each, and identify critical ones. I use the Eisenhower Matrix or simply mark tasks as high/medium/low priority. I also communicate with the team or manager if needed to adjust deadlines based on urgency and importance.


#### **18. Describe a time you had to learn something new quickly.**

> I had to implement a feature using Redux Toolkit within a tight deadline. Although I hadn't used it before, I followed the official docs, watched a few tutorials, and built a small demo to understand the flow. Within 2 days, I was able to integrate it into the project successfully.



#### **19. What would you do if your project was falling behind schedule?**

> I would first analyze what's causing the delay—whether it's scope creep, technical blockers, or resource constraints. I’d communicate with the team/manager, re-prioritize tasks, and if needed, suggest removing or postponing non-critical features to ensure core deliverables are met.



#### **20. How would you explain a technical topic to a non-technical person?**

> I try to use analogies. For example, if I’m explaining APIs to a non-tech client, I say: *“Think of an API like a waiter at a restaurant—you (the frontend) tell the waiter what you want, and they deliver it from the kitchen (the backend).”* I avoid jargon and use real-world examples to make it relatable.
